 * Billing.java
 *
 *      This is a blueprint for storing information related to Billing and acts as
 *      a model to transfer information between the backend and the frontend.
 *
 *      Contains identifying variables of Billing and is used by the service layer
 *      for retrieval and updates.
 *      - "id": is a unique identifier that differentiates between Billing transactions.
 *          It is also the primary way of accessing specific Billing records. This is
 *          immutable. The number combination is created by the auto-increment feature in MySQL.
 *      - "insurance_id": (nullable) the id for the insurance that could be covering it.
 *          If it"s NULL, it is assumed that the Patient receiving this bill does not have
 *          insurance OR the insurance company will not cover anything in the bill. This
 *          means that as long as the insurance covers something, then the insurance will
 *          show up in the bill.
 *      - "cost": the total cost of the appointment. The calculation will be conducted through
 *          a service class.
 *      - "status_of_payment": Shows the general progress of payment completion.
 *          - Acceptable Payment Statuses:
 *              - "PAID": the bill has been paid off.
 *              - "PENDING": the bill is still being processed or is awaiting confirmation
 *              - "INCOMPLETE": the full balance of the bill is due
 *              - "WAIVED": financial responsibility has been forgiven due to settlement or
 *                      financial hardship.
 *              - "PARTIAL": some of the payment is paid for by insurance or the patient, and
 *                      the remainder is still needing to be paid off.
 *      - "payment_type": the payment type in which the patient pays
 *          the bill.
 *          - Acceptable Payment Types:
 *              - "CREDIT": credit card
 *              - "CHECK": check
 *              - "DEBIT": debit
 *              - "CASH": cash
 *              - "DIGITAL": digital wallet
 *              - "INSURANCE": insurance covers the full thing
 *              - "N/A": Only Available if Waived or Incomplete is the current status.
 *          - Additional NOTE: if the Insurance ID is not null and the acceptable payment
 *                  type is anything but INSURANCE, this implies that the Insurance will
 *                  be covering a portion of it. Also, if there is no Insurance ID in the
 *                  assigned Appointment's Insurance ID or its assigned LabOrders or
 *                  Prescription's Insurance IDs, then the Insurance ID cannot be present
 *                  on the current billing. This will be handled in a separate service class.
