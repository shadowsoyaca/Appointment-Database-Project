 * Pharmacy.java
 *
 *      This is a blueprint for storing information related to Pharmacies and acts as
 *      a model to transfer information between the backend and the frontend.
 *
 *      Contains identifying variables of Pharmacies and is used by the service layer
 *      for retrieval and updates.
 *      - "id": is a unique identifier that differentiates between Pharmacies. It is
 *          also the primary way of accessing specific Pharmacy records. This is
 *          immutable and leads with an "PH". The number combination is created by the
 *          auto-increment feature in MySQL.
 *      - "pharmacy_name": the name of the pharmacy company.
 *      - "phone": the pharmacy's phone number.
 *      - "email": the pharmacy's main email.
 *      - "address": the pharmacy's address.
 *      - "opening_time": the time the pharmacy opens to the public.
 *      - "closing_time": the time the pharmacy closes to the public.
