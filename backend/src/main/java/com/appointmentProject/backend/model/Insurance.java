 * Insurance.java
 *
 *      This is a blueprint for storing information related to Insurances and acts as
 *      a model to transfer information between the backend and the frontend.
 *
 *      Contains identifying variables of Insurances and is used by the service layer
 *      for retrieval and updates.
 *      - "id": is a unique identifier that differentiates between Insurances. It is
 *          also the primary way of accessing specific Insurance records. This is
 *          immutable and leads with an "IN". The number combination is created by the
 *          auto-increment feature in MySQL.
 *      - "insurnace_name": the name of the insurance company.
 *      - "phone": the insurance's phone number.
 *      - "email": the insurance's main email.
 *      - "address": the insurance's address.
